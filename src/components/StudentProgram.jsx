                The Kamara Yokie Innovation Center (KYIC) is a youth-led center
                in Sierra Leone that is committed to promoting STEM education
                and developing young entrepreneurs in Sierra Leone and across
                Africa. The center is actively engaging with students to advance
                STEM education through a variety of programs and initiatives.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                One of the primary ways that KYIC is engaging with students is
                through its STEM education program. This program is designed to
                provide students with hands-on experience in science,
                technology, engineering, and mathematics. Students are
                introduced to the fundamentals of these subjects and are
                encouraged to explore their interests and passions.
                <br />
                <br />
                The STEM education program includes a range of activities,
                including workshops, seminars, and mentorship sessions. These
                activities are designed to provide students with the knowledge
                and skills they need to excel in STEM subjects. The program also
                includes practical activities, such as building robots and
                conducting experiments, to help students apply what they have
                learned.
                <br />
                <br />
                KYIC is also engaging with students through its entrepreneurship
                program. This program is designed to help students develop the
                skills and knowledge they need to become successful
                entrepreneurs. Students are introduced to the basics of
                entrepreneurship and are encouraged to think creatively and
                innovatively.

                ventures. The program also provides students with practical
                skills, such as marketing, financial management, and business
                planning. <br />

                In addition to its STEM education and entrepreneurship programs,
                KYIC is also engaging with students through its outreach
                initiatives. These initiatives are designed to promote STEM
                education and entrepreneurship in local schools and communities.
                KYIC is partnering with schools and community organizations to
                provide access to its programs and resources. <br />
                <br />
                KYIC is also engaging with students through its online platform,
                which provides access to a range of resources, including
                educational videos, tutorials, and interactive activities. The
                online platform is designed to be accessible to students across
