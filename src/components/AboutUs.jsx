                ACHIEVEMENTS SO FAR
              </h3>
              We have implemented an annual Conference “STEM for Us By Us” <br />
              Our STEM conferences over the last three years has brought together students,
              STEM educators, and business individuals. <br />
              We have leveraged knowledge and leadership in our pursuit of a strong STEM community by
              inspiring young minds and advancing the kind of science, math, and technology education
              that will assist young people move us to the next phase of realizing our vision. <br />
              We have established STEM clubs in 7 schools and 2 communities within and out of Freetown.
              Our STEM clubs have over 60 girls and 20 boys participating in our STEM programs which features
              coding, robotics etc <br />
              Three of our mentees were selected to represent Sierra Leone at last year’s First Robotics
              Competition In Geneva in which they ranked 110 out of 300 participants. <br />
